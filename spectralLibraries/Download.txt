
It would be useful to put together a script that can download the NIST libraries.
Unfortunately there's no central list, just a double link thing at https://chemdata.nist.gov/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=peptidew:cdownload
And the individual files are contained in tar and zip files, sometimes double contained.

This might just be better done by hand, along with updating the metadata tsv file

Note that for one file I even changed the filename because there was an errant space in it

It would be very good to set up a web page monitoring system so that I could detect and get a
diff whenever libraries change.

wget ftp://chemdata.nist.gov/download/peptide_library/libraries/nistmab/NISTmAb_v20190711_msp.zip
unzip NISTmAb_v20190711_msp.zip
rm NISTmAb_v20190711_msp.zip

Also note that redistribution would require an agreement. Which in principle we still have from
ages ago.
