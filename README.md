Spectral Library Format
=======================

# Introduction

The **Spectral Library Format** is a formal [HUPO-PSI](www.psidev.info/) standard and file format to store
and distribute Spectral Libraries/Archives. The target main target audience for this format
are primarily spectral library search tools and resources such as ProteomeXchange Partners who generates the spectral libraries.

## What is an Spectral Library?

Analytical chemists have long used the fragmentation pattern of an unknown analyte in the
mass spectrometer to infer structural information, but this process was
manual and time-consuming. It would also be repetitive, as the same analytes would be detected over and over again in different
experiments in different laboratories. Therefore, to take advantage
of previous identifications and automate the interpretation, it was sensible to collect such identified spectra in a “library” and use them as references for data analysis in future experiments.

The task of assigning a query spectrum to a molecular structure is simplified to finding the corresponding spectrum
generated by the same molecule, if it exists, in the reference spectral library.

Since 2006, NIST has begun to extend their library building operation to include peptides, and
data repositories such as the [Global Proteome Machine](gpmdb.thegpm.org), [PeptideAtlas](www.peptideatlas.org)
and [PRIDE Database](www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive) started to compile and release spectral
libraries from the rapidly accumulating data they collected from the
community.

## What is an Spectral Archive?

Spectral Archives are clusters of similar spectra, both identified and unidentified, across
multiple datasets. Like spectral libraries, spectral archives can
be used to perform accurate spectrum similarity–based identifications. Archives also extend
libraries, making it possible to analyze peptides that would typically remain below the radar
with traditional database searches, opening new opportunities
in areas such as proteogenomics or biomarker discovery.

## Why Spectral Library Format?

Over past yeas multiple file formats has been created to store and disseminate spectral libraries:
   - MSP
   - X!Hunter binary MGF
   - BiblioSpec SQLite
