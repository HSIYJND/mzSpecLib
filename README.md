# Introduction
The **Spectral Library Format** is a formal standard and file format in
development at [HUPO-PSI](http://www.psidev.info/) to store and distribute
spectral libraries/archives. The target main target audience for this format are
the developers of spectral library search tools and resources (such as
ProteomeXchange Partners who generate the spectral libraries).

## About spectral libraries and spectral archives
### What is a spectral library?
Analytical chemists have long used the fragmentation pattern of an unknown
analyte in the mass spectrometer to infer structural information, but this
process was manual and time-consuming. It would also be repetitive, as the same
analytes would be detected over and over again in different experiments in
different laboratories. Therefore, to take advantage of previous identifications
and automate the interpretation, it was sensible to collect such identified
spectra in a “library” and use them as references for data analysis in future
experiments.

The task of assigning a query spectrum to a molecular structure is simplified to
finding the corresponding spectrum generated by the same molecule, if it exists,
in the reference spectral library.

Since 2006, NIST has begun to extend their library building operation to include
peptides, and data repositories such as the [Global Proteome
Machine](http://gpmdb.thegpm.org), [PeptideAtlas](http://www.peptideatlas.org)
and [PRIDE Archive](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive) started to compile and
release spectral libraries from the rapidly accumulating data the community
collected.

### What is a spectral archive?
Spectral Archives are clusters of similar spectra, both identified and
unidentified, across multiple datasets. Like spectral libraries, spectral
archives can be used to perform accurate spectrum similarity–based
identifications. Archives also extend libraries, making it possible to analyze
peptides that would typically remain below the radar with traditional database
searches, opening new opportunities in areas such as proteogenomics or biomarker
discovery.

## Why a standardized spectral library format?
Over past yeas several file formats has been created to store and disseminate
spectral libraries:
   - MSP
   - X!Hunter binary MGF
   - BiblioSpec SQLite and SSL/MS2
   - SpectraST SPLIB/SPTXT
   - MassBank (focus on Metabolomics): [Links and
     Examples](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/SpectralLibraryFormat/blob/master/legacy-formats/MassBank.md)
   - Spectronaut CSV
   - ...

Each database provides their spectral libraries using one of these formats. For
example, PeptideAtlas (splib), PRIDE (MSP), GPMDB (X!Hunter binary MGF), NIST
(MSP). Some spectral library search engines support multiple formats, and some
do not, making it difficult to share libraries and compare spectral library
searching tools. In the proteomics community, there has been a long-standing
effort to standardize raw mass spectrometric data and the results of data
analysis, primarily identification. But spectral libraries straddle the boundary
between the two and cannot be adequately served by either efforts.

As there remains much fluidity and disagreement in what information should go
into a spectral library, the format must be flexible enough to fit all the
potential use cases of spectral libraries, and yet retain sufficient structure
for it to be a practically useful standard.

# Development of the standardized spectral library format
The new format is being developed by the PSI-MS working group. This repository
is used as a central point of information regarding the format's development:
- The issue tracker is used for discussions and decisions regarding the format
- The repository files contain information about current spectral libraries
  formats, the spectral library controlled vocabulary, the spectral library
  specifications, examples and tools that export/validate and visualize those
  files.
